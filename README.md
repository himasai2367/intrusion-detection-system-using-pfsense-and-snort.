#Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using PFsense and Snort

#Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using PFsense and Snort within a virtual network environment. The goal is to protect a virtual Windows machine from various cyber threats by monitoring network traffic and identifying potential attacks.

#Tools Used

GNS3: A network simulation platform to create a virtual network environment.
PFsense: A robust firewall and router distribution for advanced network security.
Snort: An open-source network intrusion detection system for analyzing network traffic.
Virtual Windows Machine: A target system within the GNS3 network to simulate real-world attack scenarios.
Project Setup

#GNS3 Network Configuration:

Create a virtual network topology within GNS3, including:
Routers and switches to simulate network infrastructure.
A PFsense firewall to act as the network's security gateway.
A virtual Windows machine as the target system.
Assign static IP addresses to all devices within the network to avoid DHCP.
#PFsense Configuration:

#Configure PFsense as a firewall:
Create firewall rules to control inbound and outbound traffic.
Implement port forwarding and NAT rules as needed.
Install and configure the Snort package:
Configure Snort to monitor specific network interfaces.
Customize Snort rules to detect relevant threats.
Set up alert mechanisms (e.g., email, syslog) for detected intrusions.
Snort Rule Configuration:

Create and customize Snort rules to detect a wide range of attacks, including:
Port scans
Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks
Web application attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting)
Malware infections
Evasion techniques
Testing and Evaluation

#Simulate Attacks:
Use tools like Scapy, hping3, or Metasploit to simulate various attacks against the virtual Windows machine.
Monitor Snort Alerts: Observe how Snort detects and alerts on simulated attacks.
Analyze PFsense Logs: Review PFsense logs to identify any suspicious activity or blocked attacks.
Fine-Tune Rules: Continuously refine Snort rules based on testing results and threat intelligence.
Additional Considerations

#Security Best Practices:
Adhere to security best practices, such as strong password policies, regular software updates, and user awareness training.
Threat Intelligence: Stay updated on the latest threat intelligence to effectively configure Snort rules.
Incident Response Plan: Develop an incident response plan to handle security incidents efficiently.
Future Enhancements

#Integration with SIEM: 
Integrate Snort and PFsense logs with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution for centralized monitoring and analysis.
Machine Learning: Apply machine learning techniques to improve threat detection accuracy and reduce false positives.
Red Teaming and Penetration Testing: Conduct regular red teaming and penetration testing exercises to identify vulnerabilities and improve security posture.

By following these steps and considering the additional recommendations, you can effectively implement an intrusion detection system to protect your virtual network.
